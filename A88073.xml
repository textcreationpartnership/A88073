            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>At our firſt undertaking of this Service we had large promiſes, for furniſhing and providing our Army with Victuall and with all materials neceſſary for a ſiege; in both which we have beene exceedingly diſappointed. Concerning the firſt, The Honourable Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did appoint 200. <abbr>

               <!-- PDF PAGE 20 -->and the adjacent Counties, to be paid to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry of the Army, whereof they never received a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but for the moſt part have beene left to their owne ſhift, and conſtrained to eat fruit and the Cornes that were growing upon the ground, and now for theſe ſixe or ſeven moneths paſt, have received but one moneths Pay, which was advanced by the City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Army hath been much diſcouraged for want of neceſſary Proviſions for their maintenance, ſo the Service hath been exceedingly retarded by the want of battering Pieces and Ball, for we had onely from <hi>Glouceſter</hi> three Gunnes of eighteene pound Ball, and to each of them fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Ball, ſo that we were forced to ſend to the Iron Mills to cauſe more Ball to be caſt, which ſpent a great deale of time; we entertained fifty Miners, and when the Mines were brought to perfection, they were drowned by reaſon of eight daies continuall raine, the Towne being low in ſituation; Notwithſtanding all which diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, after conſultation with the generall Officers, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were iſſued upon Munday the firſt of this inſtant, to the ſeverall Regiments, to make ready for a Storme againſt the next morning; but within a few houres after theſe orders were iſſued, there came a Meſſenger from <hi>Eveſham</hi> with intelligence that the Kings Horſe, being about 3000. had a Rendezvouze on <hi>Broadway</hi> and <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-Hill,</hi> and were marching to <hi>Worceſter:</hi> This intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence was immediately confirmed by Letters from the Committee of <hi>Eveſham,</hi> and from <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of Parliament, and from Colonell <hi>Freeman</hi> and Colonell <hi>Deverux,</hi> (who ſent a Copy of a Letter which he had from one of his ſervants,) ſome of thoſe Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſay the Enemy was 7000. others ſay 6000. and at leaſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113199:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 20 -->3000. All this could not have made us alter our former reſolutions, but at the ſame time we received a Letter from Lievtenant Generall <hi>David Leſley,</hi> ſhewing that he was gone to <hi>Scotland</hi> with the whole Party of Horſe and Dragoones under his command. In this conjuncture we were not a little perplexed how to carry our ſelves, for when we thought upon all the paines and hazard we had undergone, and the faire probability of our ſpeedy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing the end we propoſed therein, we were very deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to have continued in our reſolutions, and the next day to have adventured a ſtorme; but the Enemies For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces conſiſting in Horſe and Dragoones, and we having no conſiderable ſtrength of Horſe to interpoſe betwixt us and their Quarters, which were ſo neere, that they might eaſily have aſſaulted us before our breaches could be made, and ſo have interrupted us in the midſt of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; It was generally conceived a very dangerous attempt, for if the Enemies forces ſhould fall upon us before we could enter the Towne, it was the apparant ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Army: And albeit we had been aſſured to carry the place before the Kings Forces could have come this length, (which by our intelligence we finde was not poſſible for us to do,) yet having no conſiderable ſtrength of Horſe to oppoſe the Enemy, all the waies and paſſages had beene cloſe ſhut up by their Cavillry, all accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of draughts and Proviſions of Victuals had beene totally cut of, beſide many more inconveniences, from which we knew no way how to be relieved. For preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of all which, and the preſervation of this Army, for the Publike good of both Kingdomes, (which is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our deſires, and the end of all our Actions) after a full debate and ſerious deliberation, it was reſolved by

               <!-- PDF PAGE 21 -->the Committee of both Kingdomes, reſiding with this Army, that the Siege ſhould be raiſed, and thereupon or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were given for drawing off the whole body of the Army to the open Fields, which was accordingly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med next morning, without any loſſe upon our ſide, and the Enemy ſeverall times ſallying forth, both with Horſe and Boat, were beaten back with the loſſe of divers, both Officers and Souldiers. Theſe grounds and reaſons impartially weighed, will evidence a conjuncture of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities laid upon us for preferring the ſafety of the Army to the uncertaine event of a dangerous aſſault, in the now poſture of affaires, when a cruell Enemy is maſter of the Fields in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and for theſe three weeks paſt, hath robbed, plundered and ſpoiled the ſubſtance of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome at his pleaſure, deſtroying the Lands and houſes of the well affected by fire, and impriſoning their perſons, for all which he pretendeth no other quarrell, but the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance given by us to this Kingdome, which as it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with much readineſſe and cheerfulneſſe, and no leſſe expence in the hardeſt ſeaſon of the yeare, and when this Kingdome was in its loweſt condition: So we are confident to meet with the like kindneſſe and cheerfull affection in the day of our calamity, when the Lord is pleaſed to hide his countenance from us for our ſins and provocations againſt him.</p>
